# high-z-quasar-classification project
The goal of this project is to find a more effective classification criteria that tells high-redshift quasars (bright cores of distant galaxies; they encode information about galaxy formation and evolution) apart from brown dwarfs and low-redshift galaxies. The features used are photometric magnitude differences (aka 'colors'). <br>
Above is a collection of the code of the high-redshift quasar classification project. Those start with `decision boundary` include the data cleaning and training processes. Those with `pipeline` include the 
selection and combination of KNN models and the tests on their performances.
See `KNN Classification on High Redshift Quasars.pptx` for more details on the project overview and model performance.
