# high-z-quasar-classification project
Above is a collection of the code of the high-redshift quasar classification project. Those start with `decision boundary` include the data cleaning and training processes. Those with `pipeline` include the 
selection and combination of KNN models and the tests on their performances.
See `KNN Classification on High Redshift Quasars.pptx` for more details on the project overview and model performance.
